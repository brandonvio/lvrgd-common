allowed-tools: Read, Task
---

Execute tasks from a tasks.md file by invoking the constitution-task-executor agent with constitutional compliance enforcement.

## Usage

```bash
/execute-tasks path/to/tasks-file.md
```

## Examples

```bash
/execute-tasks spec/feature-tasks.md
/execute-tasks spec/parallel-pipeline-tasks.md
/execute-tasks spec/model-by-task-tasks.md
```

## Steps

### 1. Validate Input

```
TASKS_FILE = $1

If TASKS_FILE is empty:
  Display: "Error: Tasks file path required."
  Display: "Usage: /execute-tasks path/to/tasks-file.md"
  Exit

If TASKS_FILE doesn't exist:
  Display: "Error: Tasks file not found: $TASKS_FILE"
  Exit

If TASKS_FILE doesn't end with "-tasks.md":
  Display: "Error: File must end with '-tasks.md'"
  Display: "This command only executes tasks files generated by constitution-task-generator."
  Exit
```

### 2. Invoke Agent

Invoke the **constitution-task-executor** agent with:

```
Execute ALL tasks from the file: $TASKS_FILE

PRIMARY MANDATE: Execute ALL tasks from start to finish WITHOUT stopping for user confirmation. Work autonomously through the entire task list.

1. Read @.claude/constitution.md
2. Load tasks from $TASKS_FILE
3. Execute ALL tasks sequentially (NO STOPPING, NO CONFIRMATION)
4. Update checkbox IMMEDIATELY after each task: - [x] N. Task description
5. Apply all constitutional principles to every implementation decision:
   - Radical Simplicity
   - Fail Fast
   - Type Safety
   - Structured Data Models
   - Unit Testing with Mocking
   - Dependency Injection
   - SOLID Principles

CRITICAL: Update checkboxes in real-time after EACH task. Never batch updates. Keep moving forward autonomously.

After completing ALL tasks, provide brief summary:
- Total tasks completed
- Constitutional compliance confirmed
- Key files created/modified
```

### 3. Report Success

After agent completes:
- Display success message
- Confirm tasks file location
- Suggest reviewing tasks.md file for completion status
- Recommend running full test suite
